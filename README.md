# Electricity-and-Wealth-Project
Eradicating poverty is a pressing challenge and has been defined as the first sustainable development goal that needs to be achieved by 2030. To this end, different poverty alleviation programmes, including cash transfers, microfinance, and rural employment guarantees, have been initiated across developing countries. Nevertheless, such programmes require monitoring and evaluation to understand the impacts of these initiatives and ensure accountability and transparency, adjustment of shortcomings, and scaling of solutions. In monitoring and evaluating such initiatives, both direct and indirect approaches are used for monitoring and evaluation. The former often involves surveys, while the latter uses an indicator or a proxy for poverty. This project leans towards the latter approach.
