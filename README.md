#### Electricity-and-Wealth-Project
Monitoring and evaluating progress towards Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is essential to understand current gaps and delivered progress. Nevertheless, developing countries like Nigeria are data-scarce regions and make such tasks challenging. Given these considerations, this project assessed the use of electricity as a proxy for measuring wealth levels in Nigeria. The R script provides the code for grouping surveyed households from the DHS program into urban and rural clusters. The Jupyter Notebook contains the code for evaluating electricity use as a proxy for measuring wealth levels in Nigeria. Finally, the pdf file provides a summary of the project (i.e., introduction, aim, results, and conclusion).
